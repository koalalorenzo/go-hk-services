# Go HomeKit Services Bridge
o-hk-systemd is a system service written in Go that acts as a HomeKit bridge to
connect SystemD services and HomeKit automation. This project is available for
macOS and Linux, and it allows users to add new fake switches to their Apple
HomeKit home setup. When these switches are turned on, they will start some
SystemD services, and when turned off, they will stop them.

This project is designed to be easy to use and customizable. It supports custom
commands, so it does not have to be integrated with SystemD. Additionally, it
can be used with any SystemD service, making it a flexible and versatile tool
for managing services.

**Important**: This is a WIP and side project. It is not designed for system 
production usage and this project is just for fun!
