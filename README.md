# Go HomeKit SystemD Bridge
`go-hk-systemd` is a small service that act as a Apple HomeKit bridge to expose
fake switches in your home configuration. This helps you to visualise and
turn "off" or "on" services on the host SystemD.

This is a WIP and side project, just for fun! HomeKit is not designed for 
system administrators and this project is just for fun
