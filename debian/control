Description: hk-svcs-bridge is a system service written in Go that acts 
  as a HomeKit bridge to connect SystemD services and HomeKit automation.
  This project is available for macOS and Linux, and it allows users to add
  new fake switches to their Apple HomeKit home setup. When these switches
  are turned on, they will start some SystemD services, and when turned off,
  they will stop them.
